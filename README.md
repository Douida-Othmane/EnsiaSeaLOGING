Introduction
EnsiaSea is a project built (or still in the buidling phase) by second year Software Engineering students from ENSIAS. As you can see from its name, it has combined the two words ENSIAS and SEA, this combination was based on the website OpenSea, and if you can't guess yet, the goal of this project is to build a blockchain website for ENSIAS students to sell, buy, and exchange NTFs (Non Fungible Tokens). To make this project come true, it was devided into 3 parts: The blockchain network, the back-end, and the front-end of the website. This repository is the main one, and it contains the BackEnd part of the project.
